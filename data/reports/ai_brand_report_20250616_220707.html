                        Many local coffee shops offer gluten-free options, but the availability can vary depending on the location and the specific caf√©. Here are some common gluten-free options you might find:

1. **Beverages**: Most coffee and tea drinks are naturally gluten-free. Just be cautious with flavored syrups or pre-made beverages, as some may contain gluten.

                        There's no single "best" coffee shop in Calgary, as taste is subjective and the ideal coffee shop depends on individual preferences (e.g., atmosphere, coffee style, food options). However, some consistently highly-rated and popular choices include:

**For the Specialty Coffee Lover:**

* **Analog Coffee:** Known for their meticulous brewing methods and high-quality single-origin beans. Often considered one of the top spots for serious coffee enthusiasts.

                        Choosing a coffee shop depends heavily on your priorities, but here's a breakdown of factors to consider:

**Coffee Quality:**

* **Bean Origin & Roast:**  Do they highlight the origin of their beans?  Do they offer a variety of roasts (light, medium, dark)?  A good shop will be knowledgeable about their beans and roasting process.

                        I do not have access to real-time information, including the menus of local coffee shops.  To find out if there are gluten-free options, you will need to:
